The Respawn Anchor Mod is a mod that allows players to control their spawn points in relation to anchors When a anchor is placed, the mod automatically adjusts the player's spawn point slightly beneath it, making it the new point of respawn. If a second anchor is placed, the spawn point will be updated to the new anchorâ€™s location.

Note that if a anchor is destroyed/mined and it is not the most recent anchor placed, the spawn point remains unchanged. However, if the most recent anchor (your current spawn point) is destroyed/mined, the spawn point will reset to the default origin point (0,0).
