This mod adds the Rod of Discord from Terraria into Factorio!!

This can be researched after Processing Units and allows the player to teleport to any point on their screen. This item currently functions similarly to grenades or capsules so it can be put on your hot bar and used via a right click while holding the Rod of Discord

This does not currently have the Chaos effect from using the Rod of Discord as it has in Terraria however I will be implementing that system soon.

(As stated earlier this item functions similarly to grenades and capsules meaning it is a consumable, however this is not a problem since the stack size is 10,000 and each time this rod is crafted you will get another 100 charges. I wanted to implement this as a weapon, however that would require ammo so the currently implementation felt closer to the original)
