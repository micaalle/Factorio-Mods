Unlockable after explosives, this mod gives the player a RC car which can be used to explode biter bases. It also comes with a huge turret on the top and the ability to squeeze your player character and a friend into it if remote driving the car is not convenient enough for you.

The car can be remotely controlled the same way as the tank (via the map, click on the car and press remote control)

The car will explode upon destruction
